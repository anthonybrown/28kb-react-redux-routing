# 28kb React + Redux + Routing Stack

Just because your stack is awesome, doesn't mean it has to be fat.

This repo serves as a minimally viable example of how to combine the great ideas of React + Redux without compromising on your build size.

## Behind the Curtain

- React (via [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact))
- Redux (via [Socrates](https://github.com/matthewmueller/socrates))
- Action Logging (via [Redux Logger](https://github.com/fcomb/redux-logger))
- Functional Routing (via [enroute](https://github.com/lapwinglabs/enroute) + [simple history middleware](https://github.com/matthewmueller/redux-routes))
